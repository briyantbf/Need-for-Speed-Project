Need for Speed Simulation:

Overview:
The Race Car Simulation project is a Python-based application that simulates a competitive racing environment. Utilizing object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance, this simulation allows
users to customize various attributes of race cars and visualize the racing process in real-time through an interactive graphical user interface.

Project Structure:
The provided project contains the following files:

Car Classes:
Car.java: An abstract class that defines the common attributes and methods for all cars.
RaceCar.java: A class representing a race car with specific attributes and behaviors.
FormulaOne.java: A class representing a Formula One car with unique characteristics.
SportsCar.java: A class representing a sports car with defined speed and strength attributes.

Race Management Classes:
RaceTrack.java: A class responsible for managing the race track and the cars participating in the race.
PitStop.java: A class that handles the pit stop operations for cars.
FinishLine.java: A class that manages the finish line operations.

JUnit Test Files:
AditionalTests.java: A file used to test the Car constructor and enterPitStop method.
GenericConsoleTests.java: A file to test some generic program that uses console input and output.
StudentOutputTests.java: A file containing JUnit tests to verify the output of the main simulation features.
StudentOutputTestsRaceCar.java: A file containing JUnit tests specifically focused on the functionality of the RaceCar class.
